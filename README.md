Objective-C Rotary wheel tutorial "transfered" to Rubymotion
=============

This repo is a simple transfer of an iOS tutorial from Objective-C to Ruby found on that page [raywenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/9864/how-to-create-a-rotating-wheel-control-with-uikit)


I've not covered the whole page as I didnt care about the styling.

Do not hesitate to add it ;-)
